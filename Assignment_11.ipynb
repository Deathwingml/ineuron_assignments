        "\n",
        "Using logging messages is generally considered better than using print() statements for displaying messages in production code. Here are some reasons why logging messages are preferred:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Flexibility and configurability: Logging provides a flexible way to control the output of messages. You can configure logging to output messages to different destinations (console, file, network, etc.), define different log levels to filter messages, and customize the formatting of log messages. This allows you to adapt the logging behavior based on the deployment environment or specific requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Separation of concerns: Logging separates the concern of producing log messages from the concern of handling those messages. With logging, you can log messages throughout your codebase without tightly coupling them to the specific output or formatting. This makes it easier to maintain and modify the logging behavior without modifying the code that generates the log messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Granularity of log levels: Logging provides different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to indicate the severity of a log message. This allows you to control the level of detail in your logs and easily filter out less important messages during normal execution. With print() statements, you would need to manually add conditionals or remove the statements to control the output, which can be error-prone and time-consuming.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Integration with existing logging infrastructure: Logging is part of the Python Standard Library and integrates well with existing logging infrastructure and frameworks. It allows you to leverage third-party tools for log analysis, aggregation, and monitoring. It also provides compatibility with logging frameworks used in larger systems, making it easier to integrate and consolidate logs from multiple components.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Performance and efficiency: Logging is generally more efficient than print() statements, especially in scenarios where the logging messages are disabled or filtered out based on log levels. With logging, you can avoid the overhead of evaluating and executing unnecessary print() statements, leading to improved performance in production systems."

        "\n",
        "* Step Over: The Step Over button allows you to execute the current line of code and move to the next line. If the current line contains a function call, the Step Over button will execute the entire function without stepping into it. It is useful when you want to skip the detailed execution of function calls and focus on the high-level flow of your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Step In: The Step In button allows you to step into the next line of code, especially if it is a function call. If the current line contains a function call, the Step In button will move the debugger to the first line of the called function, allowing you to step through the function's execution. It is useful when you want to analyze the internal workings of a specific function or understand how the program behaves within the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Step Out: The Step Out button is used to execute the remaining lines of the current function and return to the caller. It is helpful when you have stepped into a function using Step In and want to quickly move out of the function and continue executing the rest of the code in the calling function or the main program."
