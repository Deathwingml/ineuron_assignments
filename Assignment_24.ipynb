        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between def statements and lambda expressions in Python is that they both define functions. However, there are some differences in their syntax and usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * def statements are used to define named functions with a block of code, using the def keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and a body of statements.\n",
        "  * Lambda expressions, also known as anonymous functions, are defined using the lambda keyword followed by the parameters and a single expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Function Names:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * def statements define functions with a specific name that can be used to reference and call the function.\n",
        "  * Lambda expressions do not have a specific name. They are anonymous functions that can be assigned to variables or used directly where a function is expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Function Complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * def statements allow the definition of functions with multiple statements and more complex logic.\n",
        "  * Lambda expressions are typically used for simple, one-line functions that can be written concisely in a single expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Return Value:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * def statements use the return keyword to specify the return value of the function explicitly.\n",
        "  * Lambda expressions automatically return the result of the expression without needing an explicit return statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, def statements are used to define named functions with more complex logic, while lambda expressions are used for creating anonymous functions with simpler, one-line expressions."

        "3. Functional Programming: Lambda functions are commonly used in functional programming, treating functions as first-class citizens, enabling flexibility and expressive code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Readability: Lambda expressions can improve code readability by keeping the function definition closer to its usage, especially for simple and short functions.\n",

        "Map, filter, and reduce are three higher-order functions commonly used in functional programming paradigms. Here's a comparison of their purposes and functionality:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Map:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Purpose: Map applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns a new iterable containing the transformed elements.\n",
        "  * Functionality: It takes two arguments: the function to apply and the iterable to process. The function is applied to each item in the iterable, and the transformed values are collected into a new iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Filter:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Purpose: Filter selects elements from an iterable based on a given condition and returns a new iterable containing the filtered elements.\n",
        "  * Functionality: It takes two arguments: the filtering function and the iterable. The filtering function specifies the condition that elements must satisfy to be included in the output iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Reduce:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Purpose: Reduce performs a cumulative computation on an iterable, reducing it to a single value by applying a function to pairs of elements iteratively.\n",
        "  * Functionality: It takes two arguments: the reducing function and the iterable. The reducing function is applied successively to the elements of the iterable, accumulating a result that is reduced to a single value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Map applies a function to each element and returns a new iterable of the same length, while filter selects elements based on a condition and returns a potentially smaller iterable.\n",
        "* Reduce performs a cumulative computation and reduces the iterable to a single value.\n",
        "* Map and filter always return an iterable, even if it's empty. Reduce returns a single value.\n",
        "* Map and filter are commonly used for element-wise transformations and filtering, while reduce is used for cumulative computations, such as summing or finding the maximum.\n",
