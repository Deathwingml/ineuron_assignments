        "* An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of the __iter__() and __next__() methods. The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__() method returns the next element from the iterator. Iterators allow you to traverse through a sequence of values one at a time.\n",

This generator object can be iterated over using a for loop or by explicitly calling the __next__() method.\n",

They allow you to define an iterator using the yield statement, which suspends the execution of the function and remembers its state so that it can resume from where it left off. This makes it possible to generate values on-the-fly, enabling efficient memory usage, especially for large or infinite sequences.\n",

This allows the generator to produce a sequence of values over time instead of computing all the values at once. The yielded value is returned by the generator function and can be captured and used by the caller.\n",

When the generator function is resumed after a yield statement, it continues its execution from where it left off, using the previously stored state information. This allows generators to remember their position and continue generating values efficiently."
